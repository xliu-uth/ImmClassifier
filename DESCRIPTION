Description: ImmClassifier (Immune cell classifier), a knowledge-based and lineage-driven immune cell 
    classification algorithm with fine annotation granularity yet high prediction accuracy. ImmClassifer 
    seamlessly integrates the biology of immune cell differentiation, the strength of heterogeneous 
    reference datasets and the state-of-art machine learning models. ImmClassifier cascades a machine 
    learning module and a deep learning module.
